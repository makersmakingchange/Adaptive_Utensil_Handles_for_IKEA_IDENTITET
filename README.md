# Adaptive Utensil Handles for IKEA IDENTITET

## Overview
<!--- A brief summary of the project. What it does, who it is for, how much it costs. --->
The Adaptive Utensil Handles for IKEA IDENTITET is an assistive technology device that provides a cost-effective way for individuals who struggle to grasp and manipulate utensils to eat independently.

The handles are comprised solely of 3D printed parts. 

The Adaptive Utensil Handles for IKEA IDENTITET is an open assistive technology (OpenAT). Under the terms of the open source licenses, the device may be built, used, and improved upon by anyone.

The overall cost of materials for a set of utensils and full set of handles is about $20 CAD.
